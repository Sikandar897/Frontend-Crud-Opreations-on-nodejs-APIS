# Frontend CRUD Operations on Node.js APIs

This repository contains a Flutter frontend application that interacts with a Node.js backend, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on REST APIs. The backend uses MongoDB for data storage.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using the Node.js REST APIs.
- **Flutter Frontend**: Built using Flutter for a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Node.js Backend**: RESTful API built with Node.js, handling requests and interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **MongoDB**: Data is stored and managed using MongoDB, providing a NoSQL database solution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB
- API keys (if applicable)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sikandar897/Frontend-Crud-Operations-on-Nodejs-APIs.git
   cd Frontend-Crud-Operations-on-Nodejs-APIs

## Set up the backend:

2. **Navigate to the Node.js backend directory**.
* Install the dependencies
* pm install

* Start Server
* npm start

3. **Run the Flutter app**:
* Ensure you have a device/emulator running.
* Navigate to the Flutter frontend directory.
* Install dependencies:
* flutter run

## Usage
Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can use the Flutter app to perform CRUD operations on the data stored in the MongoDB database through the Node.js APIs.

## Acknowledgments
* Node.js for the backend framework.
* MongoDB for the database.
* Flutter for the frontend framework.
